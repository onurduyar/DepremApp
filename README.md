# DepremApp

## Introduction

This iOS application is designed to display real-time earthquake data on a heat map using the Kandilli Rasathanesi (Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institute) earthquake API. The app fetches earthquake data from the API and visualizes it on the MapKit framework as an interactive heat map, providing users with an easy-to-understand representation of earthquake intensities.


## Features
- Real-time earthquake data fetching from the Kandilli Rasathanesi API.
- Visual representation of earthquake intensities using a heat map.
- Interactive map interface with zoom and pan functionality.
- Tap on map annotations to view details about each earthquake.

## Installation
- Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
- Open the Xcode project.
- Build and run the app on your iOS device or simulator.

  
## Usage
Upon launching the app, it automatically fetches the latest earthquake data from the Kandilli Rasathanesi API.
The heat map will be generated based on the earthquake data, with different colors representing varying intensities.
You can use pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures to navigate the map and explore different regions.


## API Reference
The earthquake data is obtained from the Kandilli Rasathanesi Earthquake API. You can find more information about the API and its endpoints at [Kandilli Rasathanesi](http://www.koeri.boun.edu.tr/scripts/lst1.asp) .
